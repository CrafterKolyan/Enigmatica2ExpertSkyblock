## Installing

1) Download the zipfile.
2) Extract it to an empty folder.
3) If you want to change RAM usage, Java arguments etc, see the "settings" file.
4) Double click "ServerStart" or "ServerStartLinux", whichever is appropriate.
5) Set EULA=true
6) Pregenerate the world - See below for instructions.



## Updating

1) Backup your world, including config, mods, schematics and scripts folders.
2) Delete the config, mods, schematics and scripts folders from the server.
3) Download server files, note the Forge version at the top of the changelog.
4) Extract into an empty folder.
5) Move the config, mods, schematics and scripts from the extracted zip into the server folder.
6) Make sure the Forge version set in settings.cfg is the same as the one stated in the changelog. 
	The settings.cfg file from the server files will always have the correct version.
7) Reapply all changes you have made to the server. I recommend that you keep all changes in a seperate
	folder, so you can just move them over after updating.


## Getting Started

Every new player automatically spawns on a newly created island when they join the server.
To interact with islands, you can use the following commands, that all start with /island

    create (optional int/string)[type] - The create command creates a new island in the world.
    invite [player] - The invite command asks another player join your island.
    join - The join command will have you join an island if recently asked by the invite command.
    leave - The leave command has you leave the island you're on, go to spawn, and clears the inventory. If you are the last person on the island, the island can't be claimed again.
    home - The home command teleports the player back to their home island, but has to be by default 500 blocks away.
    spawn - The spawn command teleports the player to spawn.
    reset (optional int/string)[type] - The reset command clears the island, the inventory, and starts brand new like the create command does.
    onechunk - The onechunk command creates a world border of one chunk size at spawn and resets spawn. This command is disabled by default and has to be changed in the config.
